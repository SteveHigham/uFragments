These notes acompany the linter upgrade branch.

These changes are dependant on Truffle 5 and incompatible with node
8. I don't see this as a problem as node 8 went out of support at the end
of 2019.

I have upgraded all linter modules to latest versions.
I have replaced the obsolete eslint-config-mocha with eslint-plugin-mocha.
I have updated various rules to try and keep the "look and feel" of existinmg
code.
I have completely removed the prettier plugin - see below.

When I made these changes I got various warnings because prettier was half
installed. I decided to completely deinstall it as opposed to completely
install it as thought this would be less contraversial. There are a number of
how-to's on the web explaining how to install latest prettier with eslint if
the consesus is to install it. It will then reformat every file which is
updated if I've read the documentation correctly.

I have also added an idea-test.sh script. This simplifies running a single js
test file from the JetBrains IDE. I've tested this on WebStorm as an npm
run/debug configuration. This simplifies use of the integrated js debugger.

This project does not yet support node 12 although we are getting
closer.

Currently (under node 10 - v10.23.0, npm 6.14.9):
  The linter is not reporting any errors or warnings.
  All tests are passing.
  The coverage report can be created.

Under node 8 (v8.17.0, npm v6.4.1):
  The linter errors - some components are incompatible with node 8.
  All tests are passing.
  The coverage report can be created.

Under node 12 (v12.20.0, npm 6.14.8)
npm install fails.
